                <h1>Scribe Experience</h1>
                <h2>Scribe for Dyslexic Students</h2>
                <p>For three years, I had the privilege of serving as a scribe for dyslexic students during their public examinations. I assisted students appearing for both the NIOS syllabus and the CBSE Board examinations, ensuring they could effectively communicate their knowledge and ideas. This role required patience, empathy, and a strong sense of responsibility, as I worked to support their academic success while adhering to examination guidelines. The experience was deeply rewarding and reinforced my commitment to inclusivity and helping others overcome challenges.</p>

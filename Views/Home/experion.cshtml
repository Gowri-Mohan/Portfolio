                <h2>Intern</h2>
                <p>During my one-month internship at Experion Technologies, Technopark, Trivandrum, I gained valuable hands-on experience in .NET development. I utilized this knowledge to build a sample web application with PostgreSQL as the database backend, where user authentication was implemented using JWT tokens. The application allowed users to perform basic CRUD operations on a user table displayed on the index page.</p>

                <p>In addition to technical skills, I also developed key professional and interpersonal skills. I improved my communication, time management, and teamwork abilities by collaborating with colleagues and adhering to professional etiquette. This experience helped me refine my problem-solving and adaptability skills, both essential for working in a dynamic, fast-paced environment.</p>

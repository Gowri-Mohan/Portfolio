                <h2>Performer and Learner</h2>
                <p>I have a strong foundation in classical dance, having trained in Bharatanatyam, Mohiniyattam, and Kuchipudi for over seven years, from third grade to tenth grade. This journey has allowed me to explore the rich cultural heritage and intricate expressions of these dance forms. During this time, I had the privilege of representing my school in various prestigious competitions, including the CBSE Sahodaya Festivals, where I participated in group dances thrice. Additionally, I showcased my skills in other group dance performances, contributing to my schoolâ€™s success and gaining valuable experience in teamwork, stage presence, and the art of storytelling through dance.</p>

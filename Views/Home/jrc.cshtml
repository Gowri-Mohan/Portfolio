                <h2>Cadet</h2>
                <p>As a Junior Red Cross cadet during my ninth and tenth grades, I actively contributed to initiatives that emphasized community service, teamwork, and social responsibility. I participated in clean-up drives, promoting environmental awareness and cleanliness within our school and community. Additionally, I played a vital role in providing first aid support during events such as sports day and the Sahodaya CBSE Sports Fest, ensuring the safety and well-being of participants. These experiences not only honed my ability to respond effectively in emergencies but also instilled in me a sense of compassion and commitment to serving others.</p>
